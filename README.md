1. "get_mactch_record.ipynb" is the tool that mines down the scorecard data. if you want to mine new datase, you can use PlayCricket website find the team you want to analyse, set up the filter,copy the links to this tool. Or you can prepare a word document that contains all the team names and the url links of games page. FYI: "lins" is the document I used.
2. "Final.ipynb" is the analysis tool, it has all the result and process that is discussed in the report, once you use tool 1 to prepare the data, tool 2 does not need modify
3. The zip document is the dataset I used in this project, also mined down using tool 1. You can load this zip into tool 2 and run
